Linguists at English Language iTutoring use the final versions of EFL students’ essays submitted online to [Cambridge English Write and Improve](http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/learning-english/find-free-resources/write-and-improve/) to gather data on those common learner errors that the system is not yet able to detect automatically. These essays are manually annotated for learner errors, and the annotations produced are then used to refine the tool and increase the accuracy of its error detection and for further research into the needs of EFL students worldwide.

While we don’t currently have any vacancies, we would like to hear from experienced and engaged ELT professionals who have the skills needed to read and correct these essays using our specially-designed online annotation tool.

The freelance annotation work:

* can be done to the teacher's own timetable 
* can be done wherever the teacher can get a reliable internet connection 
* offers up to 20 hours' work per week and is ongoing
* offers the possibility for annotators to develop and expand their role
* is currently paid at an hourly rate of £12 

If you are a dedicated ELT professional with:

* excellent English
* a very good eye for detail
* a keen interest in the needs of EFL learners
* availability to work for between 10 and 20 hours per week

please send an email describing your experience and skills to [jobs@englishlanguageitutoring.com](mailto:jobs@englishlanguageitutoring.com).

We are also interested in hearing from experienced examiners and graders specialising in skills other than Writing.
