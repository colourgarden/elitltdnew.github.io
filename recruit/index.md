We are looking for a strong Rails and/or Clojure developer to join our small team.

We are a young startup working to commercialise Natural Language Processing technology developed within the University of Cambridge to help non-native speakers learn to read and write English. We are fully funded and working closely with both Cambridge University Press English Language Teaching Division and Cambridge English Language Assessment.

Ideally, we're looking for candidates with both Rails and Clojure experience, but would be willing to consider a Rails developer with an interest in learning Clojure, or a Clojure developer with an interest in learning Rails.

Other desirable skills/experience include:

* Client-side Javascript or Clojurescript (particularly React/Om/Reagent)
* DevOps (particularly on AWS)
* Computational Linguistics or Machine Learning

We're a distributed team; you will be working remotely for much of the time. Ideally we're looking for people based in the UK, but would consider strong candidates from elsewhere (although no more than a couple of timezones away from the UK).

We are interested in both permanent employees and long-term contractors.

We can offer:

* A competitive salary.
* Share options in an exciting startup with real potential (permanent employees only).
* Flexible working
