We are looking for a strong Rails and/or Clojure developer to join our small team.

We are a young startup working to commercialise Natural Language Processing technology developed within the University of Cambridge to help non-native speakers learn to read and write English. We are funded by Cambridge University Press English Language Teaching Division and Cambridge English Language Assessment.

Ideally, we're looking for candidates with both Rails and Clojure experience, but would be willing to consider a Rails developer with an interest in learning Clojure, or a Clojure developer with an interest in learning Rails.

Other desirable skills/experience include:

* Client-side Javascript or Clojurescript (particularly React/Om/Reagent)
* UX design and implementation experience
* DevOps (particularly on AWS)
* Computational Linguistics or Machine Learning

We're a distributed team; you will be working remotely for much of the time. Ideally we're looking for people based within a couple of hours travel time from Cambridge, but are prepared to consider candidates from further afield.

We are interested in both permanent employees and long-term contractors.

We can offer:

* A competitive salary.
* Share options in an exciting startup with real potential (permanent employees only).
* Flexible working
